### What is [rcn.io](http://rcn.io)?
It's is a project for re-shaping bike racing landscape in CA first and USA next. Our aim is to bring more people to the sport and we know how to do it _right_.

Currently, you, as a racer have no good tools to:
* **plan your season**
  * decide which events are "A" or "B" and let your teammates and coach know
  * inspire teammates to come and race together
* **discover upcoming events** and details about them _(Yeah, NCNCA calendar is there and BikeReg, but we think it's not good enough, read below why. Btw, if you are from BikeReg or NCNCA we are more than happy to work with you and join forces.)_
* **see who is coming** to a race early, when you plan your season _(not when BikeReg registration is open, currently there is no way to say "I am coming", but without commitment, just like you would for Facebook's events.)_
* **one place to see all event details**
  * event name, type, length, elevation gain,  etc.
  * distance to the events
  * start times for your fields
  * when to wake up to be there on-time
  * link to a Strava route
  * is there anybody to carpool/share hotel with
  * history of that event and participation from past years
  * clean and reliable way to find start location _(SMS with Google Maps link to your phone in the morning would be neat, so you don't have to go to NCNCA, open pdf flyer, read where location is and explain to Google Maps how to navigate you there)_
* **understand who other racers are**

Currently we are building a product to help with the above.

We also think that _promoters_ are magical unicorns given to us by divine intervention. It's super hard to organize bike races and promoters are definitely uber-humans. It takes skill, enormous effort and years of dedication.

Thus, our next step will be to work with them and simplify the way things are, so we could have more local events.

Expenses are crowdfunded.

Private data is owned by you.
